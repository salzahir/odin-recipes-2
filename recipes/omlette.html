        <h4> Omlette Description </h4>
        <p> Quick meal made from fried eggs slight spice </p>
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>salt (to taste) </li>
            <li>4 large green chillies </li>
            <li>6 medium eggs </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong> Steps </strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Start by peeling and finely chopping 2 onions. </li>
            <li> In a large shallow (lidded) pan heat some oil.  </li>
            <li> Once the oil is hot add the sliced onions, along with salt (I eyeballed the amount here and used about 1 tsp). Allow the onions to saute uncovered for 5 minutes till they’re soft and translucent.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime finely slice your fresh coriander and 4 large green chillies. Note how finely I mince the green chillies, this is to stop anyone biting into a piece of chilli (unless you like experiencing that!) and also because I find it distributes the heat and aroma better this way. </li>
            <li> After 5 minutes, transfer the sauteed onions to a heatproof bowl and turn the heat off of the pan.  </li>
            <li> o the sauteed onions add the chopped coriander, the minced green chillies and crack in the 6 eggs.  </li>
            <li> Place the pan back on the heat and add a splash more oil, once the oil is hot add the omelette mixture, ensure it is spread evenly and cover. Cook for about 4 minutes over a low – medium flame.  </li>
            <li>   flip it over After a few more minutes check to see that the omelette has cooked completely, then place a plate with the same diameter as the pan over the cooked omelette….</li>
            <li> ….turn it over. Please be careful while doing this in case there is excess oil in the pan and you scald yourself, it’s wise to do this over the sink or a worktop in case of any mishaps.
                Slide the omelette back into the pan and cook for a further 2 minutes. Divide into six portions and serve with Afelia’s Puris for a breakfast fit for a king or with basmati rice for a simple but tasty lunch!</li>
